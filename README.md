# SMS_Spam_Classifier

Project Name: SMS Spam Classifier

Objective: Analyzing 5000+ SMS messages, performing data cleaning, removing duplicates, and classifying spam and ham messages using exploratory data analysis (EDA). Identifying data imbalance, finding the number of words and characters in SMS, and establishing correlations between them using a heatmap. Applying NLP techniques for data processing, vectorizing with TFIDF, building and evaluating machine learning models to achieve the highest precision and accuracy.

Project Highlights:

Cleaned and preprocessed 5000+ SMS messages.
Utilized EDA to identify spam (87.37%) and ham (18.63%) message percentages, revealing data imbalance.
Conducted word and character count analysis for SMS messages.
Explored correlations between word count, character count, and spam/ham classification using a heatmap.
Implemented NLTK functions and Pandas commands for data processing.
Applied TFIDF vectorization on the processed data.
Built multiple machine learning models and compared precision and accuracy.
Achieved the highest precision (1.0) and accuracy (0.952) using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm.
Improved accuracy to 0.97 by optimizing the TFIDF max_features parameter and using 3000 max words.
Transformed the project into a web application using PyCharm.
Skills Applied:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Imbalance Analysis
NLP and Text Vectorization (TFIDF)
Machine Learning Model Building and Evaluation
Python, Pandas, and NLTK
Web Development (using PyCharm)
Conclusion:
The SMS Spam Classifier project involved analyzing a large dataset of SMS messages and employing various data processing, NLP, and machine learning techniques. The project successfully identified spam and ham messages and dealt with data imbalance issues. By optimizing the TFIDF vectorization and model parameters, the project achieved a high accuracy of 0.97 with the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The web application transformation using PyCharm added an interactive component to the project, making it easily accessible to users.
